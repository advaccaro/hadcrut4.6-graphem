function [X, C, D] = rescale(X, C, D)
% RESCALE     Rescales variables and covariance matrix to unit variance.
%
% [Xs, Cs, D] = RESCALE(X, C) rescales the data matrix X and the
% covariance matrix C such that the scaled data matrix Xs and
% covariance matrix Cs have unit variance. Constant variables (with
% zero variance) are not rescaled.
%
% [Xs, Cs] = RESCALE(X, C, D) rescales the data matrix X and the
% covariance matrix C with the scale factors in vector D (by
% dividing variables by the elements of D).
